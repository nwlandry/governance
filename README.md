# Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem

This repository accompanies the article "Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem" by Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne, Nicholas W. Landry, Juniper Lovato, Jonathan St-Onge, Jean-Gabriel Young, and Alan Cohen and provides all the data, source code, and notebooks necessary to reproduce all results and figures.

### The structure of this repository is as follows:
* The `Figures` folder contains PDF and PNG files for each of the figures in the paper.
* The `governance` folder contains all of the code necessary for generating decision networks, opinion distributions, and running governance processes.
* The `Simulations` folder contains all of the data corresponding to the figures in the manuscript.

### Notebooks
* `generate_figures.ipynb` and `generate_figures2.ipynb` generate the data present in `Simulations` and also generate plots from that data.
